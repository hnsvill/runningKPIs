Are you passionate about creating experiences which help motivate millions of people to run and train? If so, come join App Platform Engineering team in the Nike Digital Engineering group to be at the forefront of this technology movement!

Nike does more than gear-up the world's best athletes. Nike is a place to explore your potential, obliterate boundaries, and push out the edges of what can be. Are you looking for passionate technologists who can grow, think, dream and create? We thrive in a culture that embraces diversity and rewards imagination. At Nike, it's about bringing your skills and talents to a challenging and constantly evolving game in a supportive work environment.


## Traits of the Ideal Person for This Job:
-  You love to learn, grow, and effectively bring new ideas into the group.
-  You have relevant professional experience or a bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Information Systems, (or another relevant field) with good working knowledge of basic computer science data structures and algorithms.
-  You can design and build web services and event processors using AWS and JVM technologies.
-  Your broad spectrum of knowledge about database paradigms, programming languages, and frameworks informs your decisions.
-  You understand scalable, highly available, and eventually consistent distributed systems.
-  You have excellent written and oral communication skills to both technical and non-technical audiences.


## The Team's Engineering Environment
Nike Digital Engineering is a big place. Our primary concern is supporting the Nike Run Club and Nike Training Club apps with a team that has a diverse spectrum of experience levels -- from industry veterans to recent college grads.

Our production code is usually written for the JVM, mostly in Scala / Akka, and deployed on EC2. We tend to prefer strong-typing and functional style over imperative style in our code. The architecture is highly distributed and decoupled, favoring availability over consistency.

We operate the systems we develop and have a rotating on-call schedule for off-hours contact but during office hours, the team as a whole handles incidents. Getting paged is rare.

We practice continuous delivery - every merged pull request goes directly to production with appropriate feature flagging. Our automation is typically scripted in python or ruby with AWS CloudFormation as the backbone of our deployment architecture.


## As a Member of the Team, You'll Be Expected To:
-  Successfully operate within our engineering environment and help it evolve over time.
-  Review your peers' technical designs, code, and tests, giving supportive feedback and asking good questions.
-  Work in a collaborative environment that rewards experiments, initiative, curiosity, and mentoring.
-  Use your database knowledge to design data storage for security, reliability, availability, maintainability, and performance.
-  Practice DevOps ensuring a culture of testing and releasing software on AWS continuously using automation and monitoring.
-  Partner with other engineering and product teams to loosely couple the service ecosystem and scalable.
-  Work with teams dedicated to mobile development, physiological science, and user experience
